## Introduction
A login page is a web page or user interface component that allows users to authenticate themselves and gain access to a secure system, application, or website. It typically consists of input fields for users to enter their credentials, such as username or email and password. The login page serves as a gatekeeper, verifying the user's identity before granting them access to the protected resources.
